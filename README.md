# HSV Color Detecting with OpenCV

This Python project uses OpenCV to perform real-time color-based image segmentation and filtering. It provides a simple graphical interface with trackbars for adjusting the color range in terms of hue, saturation, and value (HSV). The program loads an image, applies the selected color range as a mask, and displays the original image, the HSV representation, the mask, and the filtered image in a stacked layout. Users can fine-tune the color filtering settings with the trackbars.

## Features

- Real-time color filtering using trackbars.
- Visualization of the original image, HSV representation, color mask, and filtered result.
- Interactive image editing for computer vision and image processing tasks.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy (numpy)
