This Python program uses OpenCV for real-time color-based image segmentation and filtering. It offers a graphical interface with trackbars to adjust HSV color channel ranges. It loads an image, applies the chosen color range as a mask, and displays the original image, HSV representation, mask, and filtered image in a stacked layout.
